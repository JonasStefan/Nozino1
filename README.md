Hi, I am Jonas Stefan, an (hopefully) intermediate python developer that likes to do all sort of useful projects. I am currently learning a lot of python libraries  
and I am also trying to do some more advanced stuff with machine learning. My goal is to become a proffesional software engineer because it is always fun to work on 
software of all kinds.
